# TwineInterview
An Interview for Twine

If I had more time, I probably would have spent more time on design and making things look nicer.
I also would've added User Login and a database to store user information.
Eventually, I would also have had better error handling. Currently errors are printed to the terminal.
I think the next part of the project that I would have pursued would be letting users favorite jobs.
In addition, I would have liked to include the twine favicon.ico, but couldn't find it :)

The app is currently hosted on heroku: https://dreadful-eyeballs-53760.herokuapp.com/

If you want to run it locally:
  1. clone the App from github
  2. cd to the directory
  3. run "npm install" to install the necessary dependencies
  4. run "node start" to start the application


Notes about the analytics:
  There are 3 languages that are searched for: Javascript, Python, and Java
  If you input a location, the languages will reorder based on how many jobs there are with that language.
